# Copy rules for store screenshots

A screenshot headline is read in under a second, at thumbnail size, next to competitors. It has one job:
make *this* app's value obvious. Everything below serves that.

## 1. The tests

| Test | Pass | Fail |
|---|---|---|
| **Swap test** - put a competitor's name in. Still true? | "Check your news blindspot" (Ground News) | "All-In-One Study Buddy" (Gauth) |
| **Say-it test** - would a person say this out loud to a friend? | "Cardigan or coat? One glance." (HIRKA) | "Premium Immersive Drama Series" (NetShort) |
| **Proof test** - does the screen under it prove it? | "Predict your next period" over the "Period in 3 days" card (Flo) | "Smart Problem Solver" over a generic chat |
| **Glance test** - readable at search-result size (≈ ¼ scale)? | 3–6 words, 2 lines max | 4–6 line paragraphs (Otobüsüm Nerede) |
| **User test** - is it about the user, not the company? | "Ne yediğini artık bil." (TaraGör) | "We renewed the Ziraat Bank Mobile App for you!" |

**How strict the swap test is depends on the shot:**
- **The promise - shot 1, and the angle behind it - must fail for a competitor.** If another app could run the
  same line, it isn't a promise yet. A generic promise is the single most common reason a set "smells like
  AI", so fix it first.
- **The other shots use it to break ties.** Between two lines that both pass the proof test, prefer the one only
  this app can say. A plain line that names what the screen proves passes, even if a competitor could say it
  too: "Bölüm bölüm işaretle" over the episode list, or "Find the ride you want" (Uber). These shots earn
  their place with the screen's proof, and with the promise already made in shot 1 the set as a whole
  stays this app's.
- Every shot has to pass the say-it, proof, glance and user tests.

## 2. Patterns that work

Each pattern names real headlines (verified) from the library. Search more with
`search_library.py --quality exemplary --format headlines --technique <tag>`.

**A concrete number** - the fastest way to be specific (`stat-number`).
- "Get hired 30% faster with the app*" - Indeed (footnoted, so it's defensible)
- "New: Earn 3.5% interest on savings" - Cash App
- "Earn 5% back in rewards on a monthly category you choose.*" - PayPal
- Use only numbers the user can back up. Footnote anything that needs it.

**The moment of use** - name the situation, not the feature (`specific-use-case`).
- "Turn class notes into custom quizzes" - Gemini
- "Not degrees, a decision." / "What to wear, hour by hour" - HIRKA
- "Look Ahead - 15-day forecast for fall weekends & game days" - The Weather Channel

**The named pain** - say the annoying thing out loud (`specific-pain`).
- "Check your news blindspot" - Ground News
- "Same headlines, different headspace" - The Pour Over
- "Ditch the parking search stress" - Waze

**Spoken rhythm** - two short beats, like speech (`rhythm-copy`).
- "Be there soon. Really soon." - Lyft
- "Simple. Reliable. Private." - WhatsApp (works because each word is the brand's real positioning)
- "Build a habit. Share your success." - Kindle

**Verb-led job** - start with what the user does (`verb-led`).
- "Find the ride you want" - Uber · "Choose the best route" - Moovit · "Find podcasts you love" - Spotify
- Turkish: "Riskleri anında gör." · "Tam sana göre." - TaraGör

**Label: specifics** - a two-colour label then the concrete detail (`colon-headline`).
- "Exact rain timing: start to finish" · "Personal alerts: frost, sea, trail, commute" - WeatherX

**Question the user already asks** (`question-hook`).
- "Got symptoms? Get answers" - Flo · "Ürün neyi saklıyor?" - TaraGör · "Cardigan or coat? One glance." - HIRKA

**Wit, when it fits the brand** (`humour`, `wordplay`).
- "Order ahead to save time (& avoid the line)" - McDonald's
- "You wanted a sign, here's twelve" - Tinder · "Lettin' dogs out coast to coast" - Underdog
- "İndirim mmmmm" - Trendyol Go (one playful opener, then plain category words)

**One emphasised word** carries the idea (`emphasis-word`, `highlight-box`, `two-tone-headline`).
- Kindle: "Save the *words* that move you." (italic serif) · Flo: "Predict your [next period]" (white box)
- Threads: "Join the [conversation]" (yellow marker) · Gemini: "Dive **deep** into any topic" (brand blue)

## 3. Patterns that fail

| Pattern | Real examples | Why it fails |
|---|---|---|
| Category template slogans | "Premium Immersive Drama Series", "Enjoy Drama Time To The Fullest" | Every short-drama app says this |
| Noun-phrase badges | "All-In-One Study Buddy", "Smart Problem Solver", "Pro-Level Explanation" | No verb, no proof, no person |
| Spec-sheet titles | "Multi-Reference Fusion - Precise Recognition of Up to 15 References" | Engineering language, not a benefit |
| Superlative fog | "Patent Pending Technology Delivering You the Most Hyper-Local Forecast on the Planet" | Long, vague, unprovable |
| "All in one" | "Meet, chat, collaborate - all in one app", "Your AI-Powered Collaboration Platform" | Says nothing a competitor can't |
| Single adjectives | "RELAXING", "SIMPLE FUN" | Interchangeable |
| Company news | "We renewed the Ziraat Bank Mobile App for you!", "Halkbank Mobil Yenilendi!" | Users don't care that you redesigned |
| Paragraph captions | Otobüsüm Nerede, Pegasus, e-Devlet | Unreadable at store size |
| Repeating the app name | "TikTok Pro - Events" on every shot | Wastes the headline slot |
| Repeating the screen's own title | Headline "Three hooks tested, the winner moved up" over a screen that says "3 hooks tested; the most watched moved up" | The caption should add the benefit the screen can't say |
| A clever line about a side feature first | Shot 1 "Which font worked? Let the data say." for an app whose job is making carousels | Search shows shots 1–3; none says what the app does |
| Broken / translated English | "Share Amazing Sound With Friend", "AI intelligent service" | Signals low care (or machine output) |

## 4. Banned and tired phrases

Don't use these unless the user insists or the phrase is literally, provably true and specific in context.

**English:** seamless(ly) · effortless(ly) · unlock · elevate · empower · revolutionize · supercharge ·
unleash · harness · next-level · game-changer · cutting-edge · state-of-the-art · world-class · ultimate ·
immersive · stunning · magical · like never before · all-in-one / all in one place / one app for everything ·
AI-powered (as the claim itself) · smart (without saying what it does) · intuitive · user-friendly ·
powerful · take X to the next level · discover the power of · experience the… · your journey ·
at your fingertips (tired) · the perfect… · amazing · awesome

**Türkçe:** kusursuz · zahmetsiz · yeni nesil · deneyimini yeniden keşfet · potansiyelini açığa çıkar ·
sınırları zorla · fark yarat · her şey tek yerde / tek uygulamada · hayatını kolaylaştır · akıllı (ne yaptığı
söylenmeden) · yapay zekâ destekli (tek başına vaat olarak) · benzersiz · eşsiz · üst düzey · en iyi ·
kullanıcı dostu · keyifli hale getir · artık çok kolay! · yenilendi! · sizin için yeniledik

`check_set.py` flags these automatically when you pass the headlines in the spec.

## 5. Sub-lines, overlines and the two-tier caption

- The **headline** carries the idea; a **sub-line** is optional and only adds proof (a number, a scope, a
  footnote). If the sub-line repeats the headline in more words, delete it.
- An **overline** (small label above the headline) can name the feature so the headline can be about the
  benefit: Kindle "Challenges → Build a *habit*. Share your success." · NYT "Follow Today → Breaking news and
  live reporting."
- Exemplary sets in the library use two tiers sparingly; weak sets use them on every shot to cram features in.

## 6. Length, case and punctuation

- **3–6 words** for the headline; two lines at most at the chosen size. In the verified sample the exemplary
  headlines have a median of 5 words, the weak ones 7.
- **Sentence case** reads as human; Title Case Slogans read as templates (0 of 42 exemplary apps used them).
  ALL CAPS only with a condensed or heavy face that's part of the brand (DoorDash, Kalshi, Spotify).
- **No exclamation marks** except a single deliberate one. Periods are fine and make lines feel confident
  ("Free from your local library.").
- One idea, one line break where the meaning breaks: "Cardigan or coat? / One glance."
- Footnote any claim with an asterisk and put the footnote on the same screenshot, small.

## 7. Writing process

1. From the brief, write the promise as a sentence a friend would say. That's shot 1.
2. For each proof point, write three versions: a **number** version, a **moment** version and a **spoken**
   version. Pick the most concrete one that the screen under it proves.
3. Run the five tests. Rewrite the promise if it fails the swap test. For the other shots, use the swap test to
   choose between options that already pass the proof test.
4. Read all headlines in order, out loud. They should sound like one voice telling a short story.
5. Translate by rewriting, not translating (`localization.md`).
