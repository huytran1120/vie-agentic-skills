## 1. One visual system per set

A `"direction"` preset (`directions.md`) decides all of these at once from the brand colours; use this
section to judge or adjust it. Decide these once and keep them for every shot:
- **Background rule:** one brand colour for all shots, *or* a fixed rotation of 2–4 brand colours
  (Storytel, Cash App, Duolingo). Not a new gradient per shot.
- **Type:** one family, two weights at most. Same size and position for every headline.
- **Emphasis device:** one (colour word, highlight box, italic, marker). Not three.
- **Device treatment:** same scale and vertical position on every shot so the set reads as a row.
- **One brand motif, optional:** HIRKA wraps every phone in a knitted rope; Moovit runs transit lines through
  every shot; Bible and Instagram use hand-drawn loops. A motif makes a set ownable without decoration.

## 2. Layout recipes

| Recipe | Spec `layout` | What it is | Use when | Library examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Device frame** | `device` | Headline top, real screen in a simple rounded frame, often bleeding off the bottom | Default for 70 % of shots | Waze, Kindle, Flo, ChatGPT |
| **Full-bleed UI** | `full` | The screen fills the canvas; caption in a band or pill | Content-rich apps, games, when the UI is the hero | Duolingo (coloured pill), Gardenscapes (banner) |
| **Zoom card(s)** | `zoom` + `crop` or `crops` | One crop, or 2–3 crops stacked at the same scale, as cards | The proof is one or two elements on a busy screen | Flo, Capital One (720 score), ParkMobile (timer), Cash App |
| **Pulled-out callout** | `device` + `callouts` (`crop`, `scale`, optional `dx`/`dy`) | Device plus one UI element lifted out, larger, with a soft shadow, centred on its own position | Make the key element readable at thumbnail size | Indeed, Moovit ("Your bus is arriving NOW"), Gmail (Undo) |
| **Photo-led** | `device` + `background.image` | Real photo of the moment of use behind the device | Lifestyle, mobility, food, dating | Lyft, Tinder, Pinterest |
| **Poster** | `poster` | Giant type, no device | Max one per set, as a rhythm breaker | Uber "GO ANY-WHERE", Temu |
| **Span pair** | `"span": 2` (§2b) | One picture over two slots, drawn on one double-width canvas and cut down the middle: a phone across the seam, or a shared ground behind two shots | Once per set (twice only in 8+), when width adds meaning | Bubilet, Garanti BBVA; MARTI shows the failure (panorama, then plain white) |

Rules of thumb:
- The **UI must stay big**: in exemplary sets the device usually spans 70–85 % of the canvas width.
- **Straight devices by default.** Tilted floating phones appear in 12 weak apps and 0 exemplary ones in the
  library. If you want energy, use a callout or a crop, not a 15° rotation. A turned phone is right when depth
  is the message (a stack, a scene, several devices) and the campaign lists `tilt` or `3d` with that reason
  (`anti-ai.md`, "When an effect is right").
- Don't draw a branded device bezel (Apple's or anyone's hardware artwork). The renderer's `"device":
  {"style": "phone"}` is a neutral thin bezel with a pill cutout; `"style": "none"` is just the rounded screen
  with a shadow. Google Play sets, iPad and iPhone Duo use `none` automatically (Play advises against device
  imagery; a phone bezel around a tablet-shaped screen looks wrong) - `android_style`, `ipad_style`,
  `duo_style` in `"device"` change that.
- **Crop boxes** are fractions of the screen image `[x0, y0, x1, y1]`. Get them right: `crop_helper.py grid`
  draws a labelled grid to read them off, `crop_helper.py check set.json` previews every crop; or, if
  you built the screens from HTML, read element boxes with `getBoundingClientRect()` (the demo does this and
  writes `example-screens/regions.json`). End a crop between rows, never through one.
- Alternate caption position top/bottom only to make room for a photo or a tall element (Chick-fil-A,
  TaraGör), not for variety's sake.

## 2b. Span pairs (one picture across two slots)

The renderer draws a span on **one** canvas two slots wide and cuts it in half, so the two PNGs always line
up. Two kinds (spec details in `directions.md` §8):
- **Bridge** - one phone sits across the seam, centred on it to the pixel: half the phone in one
  screenshot, the other half in the next. Each half has its own caption at the top.
- **Pair** - one ground (colour, gradient, sampled screen, photo, a motif line) runs behind two ordinary
  shots; each half has its own screen and caption.

Rules (the renderer warns on each):
- **Nothing readable crosses the seam.** The stores put a gap between screenshots: text, stickers, callouts,
  hand marks and the UI that proves the headline stay on one side. The phone's body, a motif or a photo may
  cross.
- **The seam runs down the phone's middle**, so choose a screen whose proof sits in its left or right half
  (or lift it out as a callout on one side), not dead centre. `"device": {"x": …}` (0..2, 1 = the seam)
  moves the phone off centre only if a design really needs it.
- **Each half works alone** - while swiping and in Google Play's promo formats people see one at a time, so
  each half gets a headline (the right one can continue the left, but must make sense by itself).
- **Where:** shots 1-2 or 2-3 show complete in search results; a span on 3-4 is cut there. With an app
  preview video the video takes slot 1 in search, so prefer 1-2 only when there's no video.
- **How often:** one per set; two only in sets of 8 or more. Each span counts as two of the 10 (iOS) /
  8 (Play) screenshots.
- **When it earns its place:** a before/after, a journey or flow, a wide content wall (posters, photos, a
  map), or the main promise with a big phone. Not for variety.

## 3. Typography

- Use the **brand's font** if it has one (`"font": "fonts/Brand-Bold.ttf"`). Otherwise use the bundled,
  OFL-licensed defaults (`assets/fonts/FONTS.md`): `sans` (Inter Display SemiBold) for headlines, `text`
  (Inter) for sub-lines, `serif` / `serif-italic` (Store Serif, a Lora subset) or `elegant-italic` (Instrument Serif) for an editorial emphasis word; a `"direction"` picks a full pairing for you (`directions.md`). Never fall back to a
  system default like DejaVu or Arial for headlines - it's the fastest way to look unfinished.
- A serif can make a set feel editorial and human (Kindle, NYT, Tinder, Vinted, Suno - serif appears in
  7 exemplary apps vs 1 weak). A sans headline with one **serif-italic emphasis word** is a strong default.
- Display type wants slightly tight tracking: `"tracking": -0.018` (em) is the default; go to -0.03 for very
  large or condensed type, 0 for small caps labels.
- Headline size: big enough that 3–6 words fill 2 lines across ~80 % of the width. Measured on the library,
  exemplary headlines have a cap-to-descender height of ~34–47 ‰ of the image height (median 39 ‰); at
  1206 × 2622 that's roughly 100–120 px type. `render_set.py` defaults to that and auto-fits within `max_lines`.
- Line height 1.05–1.15 for headlines; never justify; centre or left-align consistently.
- Left-aligned big headlines feel confident and modern (Cash App, Storytel); centred ones feel calm (Waze).
- Sub-lines at ~45–55 % of the headline size, same family, lighter weight or colour.
- Turkish capitals: `İ` / `I` - use `"case": "upper"` with `"lang": "tr"` in the spec; the renderer maps
  `i→İ` and `ı→I` correctly (Python's `.upper()` alone does not).

## 4. Colour and backgrounds

- Take the background from the brand, ideally one flat colour that also appears in the UI (Waze cyan, Spotify
  pink/green, Kalshi brown matched to its dark UI).
- Contrast: headline vs background ≥ 4.5:1 (the renderer warns below that).
- Gradients: allowed if they come from the brand and are subtle (ChatGPT's pastels, Suno's warm orange).
  The default purple→blue or pink→orange gradient is the most common "template" signal in the weak sets
  (`gradient-bg`: 8 weak vs 2 exemplary).
- Dark UI → dark or deep-colour background; light UI → light or saturated background. Don't put a white
  screen on a white background without a frame or shadow.
- Photos: real, matching the audience, not stock smiles at a phone.

## 5. Emphasis devices

Pick one per set. Spec syntax: wrap the word(s) in `*asterisks*` inside `headline`.

| Device | Spec `emphasis.style` | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Colour word | `color` | Gemini "Dive **deep** into any topic" in brand blue |
| Highlight box | `box` | Flo "Predict your [next period]" white box on lilac |
| Marker | `marker` | Threads yellow marker behind "conversation" |
| Italic / second font | `font` (`emphasis.font`, `weight`, `scale`, `color`) | Kindle serif italic "Build a *habit*."; demo: `serif-italic` at `scale` 1.1 in the accent colour |
| Bold weight | `font` (bold file) | WhatsApp "**Message privately** with end-to-end encryption" |

## 6. When the renderer isn't enough: the HTML route

For effects the renderer doesn't have (3D/perspective devices, complex illustration), build the shot as an HTML page at the
exact pixel size and screenshot it with a headless browser (Playwright or Chrome) if the environment has one:

```html
<body style="margin:0;width:1206px;height:2622px;background:#0b6;font-family:'Your Brand',sans-serif">
  <h1 style="margin:180px 96px 0;font-size:112px;line-height:1.08;color:#fff">Kaldığın bölüm<br>hep hazır</h1>
  <img src="screen.png" style="position:absolute;left:131px;top:620px;width:944px;border-radius:72px">
</body>
```
`page.set_viewport_size({"width":1206,"height":2622})` then `page.screenshot(path="01.png")`, then run
`check_set.py` on the result like any other set. Keep the same system rules as above.

Most of what used to need this route is now a scene (`scene-format.md`): free placement, crops and lifts,
gradients, any vector shape in an `svg` layer, editable SVG output. Use HTML only for what no layer can do. The
truth rules (`design-process.md` §1) still apply: screens are `<img>` tags of the evidence files at their own
aspect ratio - no CSS filters, no stretching, nothing drawn over them. Every number in the copy must be on a
screen.
