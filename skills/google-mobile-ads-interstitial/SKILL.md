# Google Mobile Ads SDK - Interstitial Ads

Interstitial ads show full-page ads for users on mobile apps. Interstitial ads
are designed to be placed between content and are best placed at natural app
transition points.

## Workflow

1.  **Determine the user's platform**: Identify if the project is Android,
    iOS, or Unity. If unclear, ask before proceeding.

2.  **Read the platform guide** for implementation details:
    -   Android: `references/android-interstitial.md`
    -   iOS: `references/ios-interstitial.md`
    -   Unity: `references/unity-interstitial.md`

3.  **Follow these steps in order**:
    -   [ ] Load the ad
    -   [ ] Register for ad event callbacks
    -   [ ] Show the ad
    -   [ ] Verify the implementation
