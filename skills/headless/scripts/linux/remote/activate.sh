# Managed by the headless skill

This folder is a copy of the machine's config folder on your computer,
written by the skill's apply.sh each time it runs. `nixos-rebuild switch`
and `system.autoUpgrade` build it (`nixosConfigurations.machine`); the
automatic update first moves flake.lock's nixpkgs to the newest revision of
its release, and once the update has built and the machine boots that
system, apply.sh keeps that newer one. Edit the config folder and run
apply.sh: other changes made here are replaced at the next apply. The
machine's earlier /etc/nixos, if it had one, is in
/etc/nixos.before-headless.
